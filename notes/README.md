## Notes

Being a terrible undergrad student, I'm not very good with numbers and formulas. So, I *once* made these notes to keep up with my classes.

- **AE8401** (Aircraft Structures - I): Note that the PDFs in `~/resources` are required for compiling the TeX file. In case you're curious, those PDFs are generated from SVGs which were [created using Geogebra](https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/tex-works/tree/master/geogebra/notes).
- **MA8353** (Numerical Methods)
- **MA8357** (Transform Techniques & Partial Differential Equations)

#### I don't write notes these days!

... except when situation forces me to (but, I still use TeX for my assignments and project reports).
