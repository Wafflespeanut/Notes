Different methods to analyze statically indeterminate beams, truss works, etc.

I've also added a few PGF/Tikz graphics inside. Well, I didn't write those. The artwork is mine, while GeoGebra did the coding for me. The thing is, when I tried to enhance the arrows used in the picture, some bug comes in. I get the desired output, but with a "heck of errors".
