\section{Open source contributions:}
\subsection*{Mozilla:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\chref{https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/wafflespeanut/}{Mozillian}} since the summer of 2015. Occasional contributor to Firefox and Seamonkey, where I've patched simple Javascript bugs.
\item \textbf{\chref{http://servostat.youknowone.org/}{Active contributor}} to the \chref{https://github.com/servo/servo}{Servo browser engine} (project by Mozilla, currently being written in Rust), primarily concentrating on plugins, understanding DOM and improving the code structure. Some of my contributions:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Worked with my mentor and \chref{https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6829}{fixed a channel}, which enabled communication between Firefox's devtools and Servo's workers.
    \item \chref{https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7698}{Sorted the declaration statements} in the entire codebase (according to Rust's styling rules) using \chref{https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/rust-sorty}{my AST plugin} and a simple Python script.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Personal projects:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\chref{https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/biographer}{Biographer}}: A command-line based private diary written in Python, which allows users to write their everyday stories and view them later. It makes use of a simple shifting cipher to encrypt/decrypt the contents in $O(n)$ time. I've also written a Rust library for it, which uses FFI and concurrency to reduce the searching time by a factor of $\approx 230$.
\item \textbf{\chref{https://github.com/joelewis/carrot}{Carrot}}: An MVC-based webapp which lets organizations to notify their users of the changes made to their webapp(s) by using a simple <script> tag embedded on their webpage, which gets data from our server through the JSONP technique. It was made in a hackathon where I teamed up with another guy and developed the app within 12 hours.
\item \chref{https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/scripts/tree/master/python}{Various Python scripts} written mostly for solving problems in our coursework, our aircraft design project and other routines, which reduced a great deal of time for the fellow undergrads.
\end{itemize}

I'm sure you already have enough information about me from my CV, but let me explain a few more aspects which I'd like you to know.

Over the past 3 years, I've pursued various sciences including physics, aeronautics and computer science. It was only last year, when I realized the fact that all those sciences cease to develop in the absence of ``code'', which was also when my field of interest moved into the art of coding.

I believe that programming languages don't really determine someone's skill in coding, since one can always switch to another language with the help of Stackoverflow. I really hope you believe the same if you think I haven't learned a particular language.

I'm a problem solver, a quick learner and a \textit{perfectionist} with a keen eye for detail. That doesn't mean that I solve problems \textit{quickly}. I always try to generalize things up to cover all cases of a particular problem, and looking for such an algorithm does consume time, but I'll find it eventually. That explains why time-based tests can't really evaluate my skill.

I love an environment where I can enjoy learning, so that I can enhance my coding skills along the way. I think [Company] already provides such an environment, and so this would be a great opportunity for me. I'm very happy about your reply, and I assure you of my enthusiasm to contribute my best to the development of [Company].

Thank you for taking time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

$\ $

Yours faithfully,

\textbf{Ravi Shankar}
