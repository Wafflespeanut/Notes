\textit{Notable contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Apart from helping users in IRC and Github issues, I've authored \chref{https://github.com/servo/servo/commits?author=wafflespeanut}{more than 100 commits} and reviewed \chref{https://github.com/servo/servo/pulls?q=is:pr+assignee:wafflespeanut+is:closed}{more than 200 pull requests} for Servo.
\item Implemented code for parsing and serialization of CSS \texttt{grid} shorthand and longhand properties.
\item Wrote various \chref{https://github.com/servo/highfive/commits?author=wafflespeanut}{handlers} for \chref{https://github.com/servo/highfive}{highfive} (a bot that responds to Github webhook payloads by welcoming newcomers, assign/tag issues and pull requests, post build failures, etc.) and a "mark and sweep" \chref{https://github.com/servo/highfive/pull/115}{JSON cleaner} for its tests.
\item Created a \chref{https://github.com/servo-automation/servo-wpt}{watcher} that tests Servo builds in a dedicated machine, analyzes the logs, maintains a database of "rr" recordings of intermittent failures, and uses the Github API to file issues or comments to notify the people who work on such issues.

\section{Personal projects}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\chref{https://github.com/servo-automation/highfive}{Highfive}}: A Github integration (bot) to provide a friendly welcoming environment for the newcomers to open-source by tracking issues and pull requests, and assigning, labelling or commenting on them (using the Github API).
\item \textbf{\chref{https://github.com/wafflespeanut/nucleic-acid}{Nucleic acid}}: A Rust library to map short DNA sequence reads to the reference genome. It makes use of suffix array to generate the Burrows-Wheeler transform, from which an FM-index is built and used for finding exact matches in O(1) time.
\item \textbf{\chref{https://github.com/wafflespeanut/rust-catalog}{Catalog}}: A "file-backed" map written in Rust, for maintaining key/value pairs in a file (sorted with respect to their hashes), which uses binary search and file seeking to "get" the values in O(log-n) time.
\item \textbf{\chref{https://github.com/wafflespeanut/biographer}{Biographer}}: A command-line based private diary written in Python, which allows users to write their everyday stories, view them, or search through them later. It makes use of a simple shifting cipher to encrypt/decrypt the contents. It also contains a Rust library, which uses FFI and parallelization to reduce the searching time by a factor of $\approx 100$.
\item \textbf{\chref{https://github.com/wafflespeanut/free-fall}{Free fall}}: A terminal based 2D-ASCII game written in Rust, where the users try to save a jumper from hitting the cliffs. The game makes use of the terminal's raw mode and interacts with the Unix C libraries for polling the keystroke inputs and prints thousands of characters frame by frame to indicate motion.

\section{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
\item I also play with code and make some cool stuff in my free time:
\begin{itemize}
\item An \chref{https://ascii-gen.herokuapp.com/}{ASCII Art Generator} for JPEG/PNG images which \chref{http://wafflespeanut.github.io/blog/2017/03/01/ascii-sketch/}{extracts the necessary details} for generating the ASCII sketch.
\item A \chref{https://github.com/wafflespeanut/AISH}{CSS injector} that slowly injects a stylesheet into a style element in the DOM and gets rendered in realtime.
\item A \chref{https://github.com/wafflespeanut/volcano-min}{method} for selective-plotting of volcano plots.
\item A \chref{https://github.com/wafflespeanut/flight-2016}{responsive website} (for a symposium) without the use of any external libraries.
\end{itemize}
\item Blogger since 2013 at \chref{https://wafflescrazypeanut.wordpress.com/}{wafflescrazypeanut.wordpress.com} and now, at \chref{https://wafflespeanut.github.io/}{wafflespeanut.github.io}.

%I'm writing to apply for the "Backend Data Engineer" position advertised in Hacker News. I'm currently a backend engineer at \textit{Genome Life Sciences}, a bioinformatics company, where I've been writing code for backend pipelines in Python and Rust for over an year. I'm extremely interested in obtaining the position at Thinknum, which would be a wonderful opportunity for me to improve my skills in data analysis.

%I have 3 years of experience in Python and 2 years in Rust. Throughout the year in my current job, I've written a great deal of tools for handling large datasets efficiently. My prime focus has always been on producing results as fast as possible while utilizing the available resources.

%I'm a science enthusiast, an avid programmer, and a quick learner. I love learning new stuff, I enjoy solving problems (either by my own, or collaboratively with others), and I especially like to create things (let it be an app, a cool feature, an automation or anything that saves time for people).

%It's all these experiences that have built my confidence over time, and that's also why I think I'm fit for this job. I would enjoy discussing this with you in the weeks to come. In the meantime, I'm enclosing my resume along with this letter.

%Thank you very much for taking your time for consideration.

%$\ $

%Yours sincerely,
%\\
%Ravi Shankar
