## Notes

Being a terrible undergrad student, I'm not very good with numbers and formulas. I've made these notes on to keep up with the classes.

- Aircraft Structures - I (AE8401)
- Numerical Methods (MA8353)
- Transform Techniques & Partial Differential Equations (MA8357)

#### I don't write notes these days!
