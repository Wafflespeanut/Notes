Notes
=====
Being a terrible undergrad student, I'm working too hard in pursuing my bachelor's degree (in aeronautics). As I'm not good with numbers and formulas, I've created these notes. These include most of the necessary formulas and procedures related to the listed subjects, and I'll be updating these often.

But, never believe me when I assure you that I'm punctual...

By the way, I'm sure there are a few errors in these TeX files. They get executed just as desired, but with errors. So, feel free to modify it with your own enhancements.
