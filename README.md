## Notes

Being a terrible undergrad student, I'm not very good with numbers and formulas. So, I once made these notes to keep up with my classes.

- Aircraft Structures - I (AE8401)
- Numerical Methods (MA8353)
- Transform Techniques & Partial Differential Equations (MA8357)

#### I don't write notes these days!
