Notes
=====
Being a terrible undergrad student, I'm working too hard in pursuing my bachelor's degree (in aeronautics).

As I'm not very good with numbers and formulas, I've made these notes. These include most of the necessary formulas and procedures related to the subjects in my course, which I'll be updating often.

By the way, I'm sure there are a few errors in the TeX files inside. They show the the desired output, but with errors. So, feel free to modify it with your own enhancements.
